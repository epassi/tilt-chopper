Tilt Chopper
====

This prototype builds on [Tilt Sprite](https://github.com/epassi/tilt-sprite) to explore other dimensional interaction technologies. The helicopter altitude changes with the amount of pressure applied to the iPhone display. (iPhone 6s or later)

* 3D scene rendering with [Three.js](https://threejs.org)
* Accelerometer tracking with `deviceorientation` event
* Display pressure tracking with `touchforcechange` event 

Run `grunt` to build the project. Deployable build is in /builds/dev/.
